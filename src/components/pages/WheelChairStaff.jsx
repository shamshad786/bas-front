            <h3>Job Role Wheelchair Assistance</h3>
              <p><b>Help Disabled Passengers: </b> There are many disabled persons who have never traveled by air. Such passengers do not know how the boarding pass and other work will be done, the solution to this problem is Wheelchair Assistance, which helps the disabled passengers to reach their destination.
               <br />
               <br />
               <b>Check-in: </b>
               Whenever passengers like disabled, senior citizens, elderly, etc. arrive at the airport, the responsibility of wheelchair assistance also increases by treating the passenger properly and informing the passenger about the time status of his aircraft and sending them on time. Getting inside the aircraft is all the responsibility of the Wheelchair Assistance.

               <br />
               <br />
               <b>Getting On The Plane: </b>

               Passengers like the disabled, senior citizens, elderly, etc. have to face a lot of difficulties to carry their luggage along with them to the aircraft. Therefore Wheelchair Assistance is always present at the airport to carry out the baggage of passers-by to the aircraft and take off the luggage from the aircraft while performing its responsibilities.

              <h3>Take Care of Passengers:</h3>
              <p>If passengers with disabilities, senior citizens, the elderly, etc. are traveling and the passengers cannot reach the airline counter, you can ask the wheelchair staff of the airport to help you. There are usually several airport and airline staff stationed outside the departure terminal to assist passengers. Avoid questioning the security personnel. 
               <br />
               <br />
               When you get a wheelchair, you also get an attendant. This person will be responsible for ensuring that you sit in your seat inside the aircraft. He will push your wheelchair, pick up your luggage and get your luggage checked. He will then take you through the security check and park your wheelchair at the gate from where your flight will take place.
